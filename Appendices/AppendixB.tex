In the study presented in Appendix B, I compared traces extracted by CITE-On with those extracted by CaImAn [\cite{giovannucci2019}], a state-of-the-art method  based  on constrain non-negative matrix factorization (Supplementary Figure 4 and 6).
I compared different background extraction methods and the correlation between traces for each method (Supplementary Figure 4 and 6), as well as the relationship with signal-to-noise ratio of putative neurons and correlation between methods (Supplementary Figure 4 and 6).
