\noindent I would like to thank my mentor Tommaso Fellin for guiding me during these years. 
For his teachings and advise both in science and in life. 
For the discussions, the dedication and for always being available.
I would like to thank Stefano Panzeri and Jacopo Bonato for collaboration and helpful comments.
I would like to thank the people from Tommaso's group, a great and supportive team, for all the science and all the laughter.  
I would especially like to thank Sebastiano Curreli and Sara Romanzi, without whom this thesis would not exist. 
I would like to thank them not only for their exceptional experimental work, that produced all the data presented in this thesis, but most importantly for all the discussions, the support and for helping making the experience of doing science an exciting and enjoyable adventure. 
I would like to thank Camila for the support and the love. For \textit{todo lo todo} that she is in my life.

My highest gratitude is for my parents, Carmen and Juan. I don't have the words to thank them enough. I would like to dedicate this thesis to them.
